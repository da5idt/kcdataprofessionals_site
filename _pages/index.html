    <h1>Purpose</h1>

    <p>
        Kansas City Data Professionals (KCDP) exists to connect, educate, and inspire individuals working across the full
        spectrum of the data profession from engineering and architecture to analytics, science, visualization,
        governance, and AI. Our goal is to strengthen Kansas City's data ecosystem by fostering collaboration, sharing
        knowledge, and building relationships among practitioners.
