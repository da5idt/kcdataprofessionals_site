## Support Kansas City Data Professionals

Kansas City Data Professionals is a practitioner-led, vendor-neutral community focused on real-world data leadership, engineering, analytics, and platform design.

We welcome sponsorships that help us:

- Provide high-quality venues
- Offer food and refreshments
- Keep events accessible
- Grow the regional data ecosystem

Sponsorship enables the community. It does not influence content.

## Our Commitment to Independence

KCDP is built on a simple foundation:

- We do not endorse products or services.
- Sponsors do not control topics or speakers.
- Events prioritize education, not marketing.
- No sales pitches from the stage.

We believe long-term trust is more valuable than short-term funding.

**Event Sponsors**
